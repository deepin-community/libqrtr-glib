libqrtr-glib (1.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 1.2.2
  * d/watch: watch for git tags instead of release tarballs.
    Upstream doesn't publish release tarballs anymore, but instead relies
    on git tags now. Update the `watch` file accordingly.
  * debian: switch build system to meson.
    Upstream dropped support for autotools-based builds starting with
    version 1.2.0 in favor of meson. This requires the following changes on
    our side:
    - change configure flags
    - modify build dependencies to depend on `meson` instead of
      `autoconf-archive`
    - add corresponding new copyright entries and update global project
      license
    While doing so, this commit also bumps the `glib2.0` minimum version
    to reflect upstream changes and drops an unnecessary dependency on
    `debhelper`.
  * d/upstream: remove signing key.
    With the move to git tags-based releases, tarballs are no longer signed.
    Therefore we can drop our copy of the upstream signing key.
  * d/libqrtr-glib-dev: don't install static library.
    It isn't generated anymore.
  * d/rules: drop obsolete override.
    With the build system change, overriding `dh_missing` isn't needed
    anymore: the files we used to exclude are no longer created.
  * d/libqrtr-glib-doc: rename README and add lintian override.
    Reflect the renaming of `README` to `README.md`.
    Moreover, documentation generated by `gtk-doc` is installed to
    `/usr/share/gtk-doc` as expected. Add a corresponding lintian override,
    otherwise it will complain about docs installed outside
    `/usr/share/doc`.
